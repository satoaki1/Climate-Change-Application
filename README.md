# OOP Application Project

## Introduction
This is the Java Project to build an application to tackle with the worldwide climate change issue.

## Background

Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13 or Goal 13) is about climate action and is one of 17 SDGs established by the United Nations in 2015. The official mission statement of this goal is to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts". There are 5 main targets of this SDG in total, all of which cover a wide range of issues surrounding climate action.

1.	Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries.

2.	Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.

3.	Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.

4.	Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly
$100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible.

5.	Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities
* Acknowledging that the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change.
